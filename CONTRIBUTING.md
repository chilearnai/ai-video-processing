# Contributing to the Project

Thank you for showing interest in our project! We appreciate your time and effort. Please review the contribution guidelines below to help us maintain a smooth and productive collaboration.

## Contribution Guidelines

### 1. Fork — Branch — PR
- Do **not push directly to the `main` branch** (unless agreed upon).
- **Create a branch** from `main` to make your changes.
- After making your changes, open a **Pull Request (PR)** with a clear description: what was done and why.

### 2. Commit and PR Descriptions
- Commits should be concise and meaningful:  
  `fix: resolved video loading bug`, `feat: added support for mp4 files`.
- In the PR, provide a description: what was done, why, and how it can be tested.

### 3. Code Review — It's Not Just a Formality
- Read and review others' code.
- Ask questions if anything is unclear.
- Always aim for constructive feedback to improve the code quality.

### 4. Follow Code Style Guidelines
- Maintain consistency in code formatting, linting, and hooks.
- Stick to the agreed-upon style for the project rather than coding as you prefer.

### 5. Creating Issues and PRs
- If you find a bug or want to suggest a feature, please **open an Issue**.
- If you are confident about the solution, feel free to propose a **PR** to resolve the issue or implement the feature.

### 6. Documentation Is Part of the Code
- Every change should be well documented.
- Update the **README** and add comments in the code where necessary.

### 7. How to Propose a Feature
- When proposing a new feature, please **create an Issue** first to discuss the feature.
- Clearly outline the use case, why it’s needed, and any implementation details.
- If the feature is accepted, you can create a branch and submit a PR implementing the feature.

### 8. How to Add a New Dependency
- If you're adding a new dependency (e.g., a library or package), make sure to check with the team first.
- Ensure the dependency is well-maintained, documented, and necessary for the project.
- Document the usage of the new dependency in the README if it affects the setup or build process.

### 9. Not Sure? Ask!
- If you’re unsure about an approach or solution, it’s better to ask in the chat or leave a comment on the Issue.
- This will help avoid mistakes and ensure that everyone is on the same page.

### 10. Respect and Positive Communication
- Be respectful and constructive in your interactions.
- This is an open-source project built on collaboration — let's foster a positive and inclusive environment for everyone.
